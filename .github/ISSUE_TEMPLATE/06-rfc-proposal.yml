        RFCs are for proposing significant changes that affect the project's direction, architecture, or community.

        **Before submitting**, consider if this could be handled as a regular feature request or bug report instead.

        **When to use this template:**
        - New major features or significant API changes.
        - Breaking changes or deprecations.
        - Architectural decisions or design patterns.
        - Process changes or governance updates.
        - Cross-project initiatives.

        **What happens after submitting?**
        1. **Triage**: Maintainers will review and assign an RFC number.
        2. **Discussion**: The relevant parties will discuss and provide feedback on the proposal.
        3. **Iteration**: You may need to update the proposal based on feedback.
        4. **Decision**: Core maintainers will make a final decision.
        5. **Implementation**: If accepted, work can begin on implementation.
