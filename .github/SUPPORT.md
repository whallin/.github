# Getting support

Need help, want to brainstorm, or have an idea to share? This page outlines the easiest ways to reach me and get support.

Whether you're exploring public projects or using personal tooling, the links and contacts below will guide you to the right place.

## Where to go

### 💬 GitHub Discussions — open conversations

**Best for:** Broad discussion, brainstorming, demos, design feedback, or general community chat.

### 🐛 GitHub Issues — for tracked problems

**Best for:** Reproducible bugs, feature requests, or anything that needs tracking and follow-up.

### 📧 Direct contact — email me

- **General support & discussions:** [william@hallin.media](mailto:william@hallin.media)
- **Security issues:** See the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'm human — replies may take a day or two, but I'll respond as soon as I can.

## Try these first

Before opening an issue or emailing me, these resources often have answers:

### 📚 Read the docs

- **Repository READMEs** — Setup steps, usage examples, and common troubleshooting notes.
- **Wiki pages** — Longer design notes and architecture documentation.
- **API docs** — If available, links are usually in the README.
- **Examples & demos** — Look for `examples/` or `demos/` folders for working samples.

### 🔎 Search smart

- **GitHub search** — Scan issues and discussions across my repositories; your question might already be answered.
- **Pull request notes** — PR descriptions and review threads often contain helpful context and workarounds.

> [!TIP]
> Put error messages in quotes when searching — e.g. "TypeError: Cannot read property" — to find exact matches.

## How to get quicker, useful answers

### 📝 Make your report actionable

- **Give context:** What you were trying to do, steps you took, what happened vs. what you expected, and environment details (OS, versions, browser).
- **Add details:** Full error output, formatted code snippets, and screenshots or recordings where helpful.
- **Keep it focused:** One problem per issue, a clear title, and a concise description.

### 👍 Examples that help

- "The docs say to run A but I get B. Here's my config and the exact error. Am I missing a step?"
- "I think there's a bug in the validator — here's a minimal repro and steps to reproduce."

#### Not so helpful — what to avoid

- "It doesn't work"  
  **Instead:** show what you tried, the expected result, and the actual output (include logs or screenshots).

- "Your software is broken"  
  **Instead:** explain the feature, provide reproduction steps, and why you think it's a bug.

- "This is urgent!!!" (with no details)  
  **Instead:** describe the impact, deadline, and any temporary workarounds so I can triage.

## Community support

### 🤝 Help others, help yourself

Even if you're not an expert, sharing what you learned helps others facing similar problems.

If docs are confusing, improve them or create a short issue describing the gap — small fixes help everyone. When you find a workaround, include the steps so others can benefit.

**If you remember being new to all this, pay it forward** — welcome newcomers and point them to the right resources.

### 🌟 Want to help regularly?

Regular contributors often become go-to helpers — it's a great way to give back. If you'd like to take on a mentoring or support role, email me at [william@hallin.media](mailto:william@hallin.media).
