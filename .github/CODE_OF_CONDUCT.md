# Code of Conduct

I aim to maintain a welcoming, respectful, and safe atmosphere across my projects. This Code of Conduct explains expected behavior, examples of unacceptable conduct, how to report issues, and how I will respond.

## Where this policy applies

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issue trackers, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and any in-person events where you represent the project or interact with me.

I am committed to ensuring an inclusive, harassment-free environment for contributors and participants.

## Expected and unacceptable behavior

### Expected behavior

- Treat others with respect and use considerate language.
- Assume positive intent and give feedback that is constructive and actionable.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and lend a hand when possible.
- Keep discussions focused and relevant to the topic at hand.

### Unacceptable behavior

The following are examples of behavior that will not be tolerated:

- Harassment, threats, or intimidation of any kind.
- Discrimination or hateful language aimed at protected characteristics.
- Personal attacks, insults, or disclosure of private information (doxxing).
- Deliberate disruption, trolling, or spamming.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern.

## How to report concerns

If you encounter or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to me at [william@hallin.media](mailto:william@hallin.media).

When making a report, include what happened, when and where it took place, and any relevant links or screenshots. You don’t need to provide proof — tell me what you saw.

## Enforcement and resolution

Reports will be reviewed carefully and handled confidentially. Responses may include private warnings, temporary or permanent removal from project spaces, or other suitable actions.

Decisions will be made by me or by a moderator I designate. If you have concerns about how a report was handled, contact [william@hallin.media](mailto:william@hallin.media).

## Tone and enforcement

I encourage a friendly, inclusive tone, but enforcing this Code of Conduct can require firm measures — my priority is a safe and productive community for everyone.
